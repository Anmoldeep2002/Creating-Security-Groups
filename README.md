<h1>Creating Security Groups</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this section, I'm going to create security groups within the domain. These security groups will grant users the appropriate permissions to access shared drives under their account. In this situation, John will be added to security groups and granted access to the HR and Personal folders.</p>
